                <p><strong>One Pot of Flavorful Bean Products</strong></p>
                <p>Daxi braised tofu is now a highlight of street food. Lao Aba evolved from his early single braised tofu product to today's family operation where each member handles different items - vegetarian chicken, vegetarian sausage, vegetarian tripe, tofu skin rolls, and orchid tofu. Each item is carefully selected from different specialty suppliers, creating one pot of tofu products like a small department store.</p>
                <p>"Not flavorful enough" is a forbidden phrase in Lao Aba's shop. The secret braising method seeps from outside to inside, complemented by generous amounts of garlic and chili sauce, giving the simple tofu flavor rich and layered dimensions. Don't forget to add a spoonful of the private chili sauce - that's the addictive taste.</p>

                <p><strong>Heritage of Hot Braised Tofu Flavors</strong></p>
                <p>Huang Damu's tofu can be adjusted according to personal preference for saltiness and spiciness. The tofu that has absorbed all the sauce and broth not only has thickness and chewiness but is also juicy, with rich bean aroma spreading in your mouth.</p>
                <p>Especially the shop's special chili sauce - just a little bit makes you sweat at your forehead, perfect for stimulating appetite in hot summer weather. Besides eating the tofu here, consider buying a pack to take home and extend the flavor memory of your Daxi trip.</p>
                <p>If you have time, we highly recommend trying tofu from every shop on Daxi Old Street. Definitely dine in at the shops to taste the freshly braised tofu while experiencing the unique hot steaming atmosphere characteristic of Daxi's braised tofu culture.</p>
